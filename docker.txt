A docker continer is a software program that runs operating systems virtually. It enables appilcation sharing between 
cloud and on premise making applications developed on docker accessisble from anywhere. One use that comes to mindfrom 
my work environment, is using docker for ERP applications thathave various modules and require security and easy access 
from anywhere.
